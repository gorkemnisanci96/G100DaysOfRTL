What is the difference between an initial and <br /> of the systemverilog?  <br />

```
initial block occurs at the beginning of the simulation and the final block occurs at the
end of the simulation.  


module day47_1;
  initial begin
    $display("Initial Message 1 Time:%0tns",$time);
    #10;
    $display("Initial Message 2 Time:%0tns",$time);
    #20;
    $finish;
  end
  
  final begin
    $display("Final Message 1 Time:%0tns", $time);
  end
endmodule :day47_1

Output: 
Initial Message 1 Time:0ns
Initial Message 2 Time:10ns
Final Message 1 Time:30ns

What is “This ” keyword in the systemverilog?  <br />
```
This keyword is used to refer to the class properties, parameters and methods of the current instance. 

class myclass;
  
  string classname;
  
  function new (string name);
    this.classname = name;
    this.printmessage();
  endfunction
  
  function void printmessage();
    $display("[MSG]: The Class Object is Created with name %s",this.classname);
  endfunction 
endclass

module day47();
  
myclass class1;
    
  initial begin 
    class1 = new("puffy");
    #10;
    $finish;
  end 
    
endmodule 

Output: 
[MSG]: The Class Object is Created with name puffy
